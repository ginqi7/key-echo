## Key-Echo
Key-Echo is an Emacs plugin that uses XRecord technology to listen to system key events. It can listen to some special single key events, such as when the user only presses the Shift key without pressing other letter keys, it sends a signal to Emacs to execute some Elisp code, such as switching input methods.
